# System-Programming
My system programming journey — low-level C programs exploring Linux system calls, file systems, and OS internals.

This repository marks the beginning of my **system programming journey**.  
Here, I explore **UNIX internals** and low-level programming concepts using **C on Linux**, focusing on how operating systems work internally.

The goal of this repository is **learning by building** — writing small, focused programs that interact directly with the OS through system calls.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Linux system calls
- File and directory handling
- File descriptors and low-level I/O
- Process management
- Memory concepts
- Understanding OS internals through hands-on coding

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: **C**
- Platform: **Linux**
- Tools: `gcc`, `make`, Linux system calls

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build a strong foundation in **system-level programming**
- Understand **how the OS interacts with user programs**
- Prepare for advanced topics like **OS internals, kernels, and performance-critical software**

---

## 🚧 Status

This repository is a **work in progress**.  
Code quality and complexity will improve as my understanding deepens.

---

## 📌 Note

This is a **learning-focused repository**.  
Some programs may be experimental, incomplete, or intentionally simple to demonstrate core concepts.
